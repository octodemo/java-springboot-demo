# Adding Screenshots to README

## Instructions for Adding the UI Screenshots

To complete the README with the actual screenshots, you need to save the two UI images you provided as:

1. **Green Environment Screenshot**: 
   - Save as: `docs/images/green-environment.png`
   - Shows the green-themed UI with search functionality enabled

2. **Blue Environment Screenshot**:
   - Save as: `docs/images/blue-environment.png` 
   - Shows the blue-themed stable UI without search features

## How to Add the Images

1. Save the images in the `docs/images/` directory with the exact filenames mentioned above
2. The README.md file is already configured to reference these images
3. Once saved, the images will automatically appear in the README when viewed on GitHub

## Current Status

âœ… README structure updated with enhanced descriptions
âœ… Image references added to README 
ðŸ”² Actual PNG files need to be saved (you can add these manually)

The README now includes:
- Modern app description with key features
- Enhanced technology stack
- Professional presentation of the Blue/Green deployment concept
- Placeholder references for the UI screenshots
