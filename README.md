# Java Demo App

## Overview

This is a simple Sales Manager Java App that stores sales items in a table presented in a web app. This demo repo is designed to help understand some of **CI/CD** ([Continuous Integration](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration)/[Continuous Delivery](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/deployment/about-deployments/about-continuous-deployment)) principles and best practices.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Java (Spring Boot framework)
- **Design Patterns:** MVC (Model View Controller) and OOP (Object Oriented Programming)
- **Database:** [PostreSQL 10.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10-4.html) (compatible with other versions)
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions)

## CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline is optimized using various tools. See the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/cd.yml` for more detailed configuration.

### Continuous Integration

- [Caching Dependencies to Speed Up Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows)
- Docker Layer Caching with [action-docker-layer-caching](https://github.com/satackey/action-docker-layer-caching) or [build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) actions.
- [Metrix Strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs) for parallel unit testing.
- [Split Test Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/split-tests) for splitting tests across multiple runners.
- [GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) with [CodeQL analysis](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-the-codeql-workflow-for-compiled-languages).
- [Liquibase Quality Checks](https://www.liquibase.com/quality-checks) for enforcing database schema changes best practices.

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment

- [Environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) with an [approval step review](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/reviewing-deployments) prior to [deployments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/about-deployments)
- [azure/login action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login) for [OIDC (OpenID Connect)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) functionality.
- [Canary or Blue-Green deployments](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-bluegreen-canary) in an AKS (Azure Kubernetes) Cluster.
